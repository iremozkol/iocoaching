## Individual Counselling ##

  Individual Psychological counselling focuses on the resolution of problems that you experience in yourself and gives the individual the ability to deal with these challenges. With psychological counselling, you are provided with the support in finding a way to understand yourself, to increase your quality of life by enhancing self-awareness to live a more harmonious and healthy life. 
  Individual counselling services are offered in areas such as private, social, academic, and work problems. Other areas of support can be found in adjustment problems, anxiety disorders, panic attacks, trauma experiences, depression, unhappiness, loss, and the mourning process. • The duration of the individual counselling psychotherapy session is between 45-50 minutes. Depending on the nature of the problem, it can be presented once or twice a week.
