### Child Counselling

  Child psychology is at the heart of psychological development. Problems that are not acknowledged and ignored between the ages of 0-6, stimulate and build the foundations for problems in adolescence and adulthood. Children find it difficult to fully express their thoughts and feelings like adults. Therefore, the observation of the behavioural and emotional skills of the families is of great importance in order to understand the child's need for therapy.
