I am Clinical Psychologist İrem Özkol. I hold an Honors degree in Guidance and Psychological Counseling from Istanbul Yeditepe University and a Master’s degree in Clinical Child Psychology from Anglia Ruskin University in the UK. I have been serving in the field of mental health for over three years.

Throughout my academic and professional journey, I have attended numerous seminars and courses to enhance my expertise. I gained practical experience through internships at Special Education and Rehabilitation centers, as well as at various schools and clinics. Additionally, I served as a specialist report writer for the Family Courts at the Istanbul Kartal Anadolu Justice Palace between 2015 and 2016.

My personal and professional interests focus deeply on the impact of the bonds formed between an individual and their caregivers on their future quality of life. In this context, my master's thesis explored "Attachment Styles and Interpersonal Void." 

My commitment to professionalism and ethical standards is reinforced by my memberships in the British Psychological Society and the British Association for Counselling and Psychotherapy.
